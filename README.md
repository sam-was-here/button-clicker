# button-clicker
This is the repo for a electronic button clicker. A button clicker is a small electronic device that counts how many times the button on the devices was pressed. there is another button that show the count on the device to save battery. The max count on the deive is 999,999 and has a button debounce time of about 10ms. all the counting is done with BCD counters and is displayed on 7 segment displays usesing BCD to 7 segment IC. the deive is about 4 X 1 X 0.65in big. There is a 3d printed case for holding the PCB. The PCB is a 2 layered boared with 0.15mm trace width and spacing. Most componces are are SMD (excpeted the buttons and the displays). If you do decide to make this project you will need to add shielding inside of the case or else the button clicker will randomly count up, reset, or count down. All the electronics was done using KiCad and the case was made using FreeCAD (all desing files are in the repo if you want to make modications).
